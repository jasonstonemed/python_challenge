### PyBank Challenge - Revisited Readme

#### Overview:

The PyBank Challenge - Revisited is a Python script designed to analyze financial data provided in a CSV file (`budget_data.csv`). The script calculates key financial metrics and outputs the results to the console.

#### Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- `budget_data.csv` file containing financial data with columns "Date" and "Profit/Losses."

#### Instructions:

1. **Download the Script:**
   - Download the Python script `pybank_challenge.py` and save it in the same directory as your `budget_data.csv` file.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where the script (`pybank_challenge.py`) is saved.
   - Run the script by entering the command: `python pybank_challenge.py`.

3. **View Results:**
   - The script will output the following financial analysis results:
     - Total months in the dataset.
     - Net total of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
     - Average change in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
     - Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the period.
     - Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the period.

#### Example Output:

```plaintext
------------------
Financial Analysis
------------------
Total Months: 86
Total Profit: $38382578
Average change in Profit/Losses over 86 months is: $-2288
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 $1926159
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 $-2196167
------------------
```

#### Notes:

- The script utilizes the `csv` and `os` modules to read the CSV file and handle file paths.
- Financial metrics are calculated, including total months, net total profit/loss, average change, and the greatest increase/decrease in profits.
- The results are printed to the console for easy viewing.

#### Disclaimer:

This script assumes the input CSV file (`budget_data.csv`) adheres to the specified format, and data is valid. Ensure that the file is present in the same directory as the script.
